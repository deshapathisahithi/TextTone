During the British Raj in 1920, Governor Scott Buxton and his wife Catherine visit a forest in Adilabad, where they abduct Malli, an artistically talented young girl from the Gond tribe. The tribe's guardian Komaram Bheem embarks for Delhi to rescue her, disguising himself as a Muslim named Akhtar. The Nizamate of Hyderabad warns Buxton's office of the impending danger and advises them to return the child. Undeterred, Catherine enlists A. Rama Raju, an ambitious Indian Imperial Police officer, to quell the threat, promising a promotion should he capture Bheem alive. Raju and his uncle Venkateswarulu attend a pro-independence gathering in disguise, where Bheem's aide Lachhu attempts to recruit them into Bheem's plot. On the way to Bheem's hideout, Lachhu discerns Raju's identity and flees. Shortly afterward, Raju and Bheem witness a child getting trapped by a train wreck and work together to rescue him. Unaware of their opposing allegiances, they form a close friendship.

With Raju's help, Bheem courts an Englishwoman named Jenny, discovering that she is staying with the Buxton. Following a party where Raju and Bheem out-dance the pompous English attendees, Jenny invites Bheem to her residence, where he finds Malli and promises to free her soon. Meanwhile, Raju locates Lachhu and apprehends him. While being interrogated, Lachhu sets a banded krait onto Raju and warns him of his imminent death and that the antidote is only known to the Gonds. Bheem finds Raju, saves his life, and divulges his tribal identity and mission, unaware of Raju's true identity. That night, at an event to honour Governor Buxton, Bheem's men barge into his residence with a truck filled with wild animals, as they maul Scott's guards, creating havoc among the guests. Raju arrives and fights Bheem; Bheem is forced to stand down when Buxton holds Malli at gunpoint. Bheem is arrested and Raju is promoted.

A flashback reveals that Raju's father Alluri Venkatarama Raju was a revolutionary who hoped to arm his village with British rifles but was killed by British soldiers before he got the chance. Raju subsequently left his village and his fiancee Sita to become a mole within the police, his promotion for having captured Bheem finally giving him access to the gun shipments. At Bheem's public flogging, Raju attempts to persuade him to recant his actions; Bheem chooses flogging instead. Bheem sings in defiance of his injuries, inciting the assembled crowd into rebellion, and further enlightening Raju. He persuades Buxton to execute Bheem in secrecy in front of Malli while preparing an ambush to rescue both of them, but Buxton discovers the plan, and Raju is injured while rescuing Malli. Bheem, thinking Malli is in danger, bludgeons Raju and escapes with the girl. Raju is arrested for treason and imprisoned in solitary confinement.

Months later, Bheem, who is hiding with his group and Malli in Hathras, is cornered by the colonial authorities. He narrowly avoids being exposed when Sita repels them by claiming there is a smallpox epidemic. Unaware of Bheem's identity, she reveals Raju's anti-colonial objectives and his impending execution. Realising his folly, Bheem vows to save him. With Jenny's sympathetic assistance, Bheem infiltrates the barracks where Raju is detained and frees him. The pair retreat to a nearby forest, where they defeat soldiers with a longbow taken from a Rama shrine and a spear. Taking the fight to Buxton, they hurl a flaming motorcycle into the barracks' magazines, setting it afire. Bheem steals a cache of guns for Raju before the barracks explode, killing many soldiers and Catherine. Cornering a wounded Buxton, Raju has Bheem execute him with a British rifle, fulfilling their respective objectives. Raju is reunited with Sita, and Bheem is reunited with his tribe. To mark the mission's successful completion, Raju asks Bheem to make a wish he can grant; Bheem asks Raju to provide education for him and his community.
